    "Q1. Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical values. The key difference is that ordinal encoding assigns numerical values based on the ordinal relationship between categories, whereas label encoding assigns arbitrary numeric labels without considering any order. For example, in a \"Size\" feature where categories are \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" ordinal encoding might assign values 1, 2, and 3, respectively, because there's an inherent order. In contrast, label encoding could assign values like 0, 1, and 2, merely for identification purposes. You might choose ordinal encoding when categories have a meaningful order (e.g., low, medium, high) and label encoding when there's no ordinal significance."

    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where categorical values are assigned ordinal labels based on their relationship with the target variable's mean or another aggregation. This encoding can capture valuable information about the correlation between a categorical feature and the target variable. For instance, in a machine learning project to predict credit risk, you might use target-guided ordinal encoding to assign risk levels (e.g., low, medium, high) based on historical default rates. This way, the encoding considers the target variable's relationship, which can improve the predictive power of the feature."

The magnitude of covariance is not standardized, making it difficult to compare across datasets. Covariance is calculated using the formula:\n",
