    "\n",
    "### SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases that differ in their data storage and retrieval approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL databases are structured and use a fixed schema, which means that the data is stored in tables with predefined columns and rows. SQL databases are relational, meaning they can store data in tables that are connected through keys or relationships. This structure makes it easy to query and manipulate data, using SQL commands to perform tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. SQL databases are commonly used for managing structured data such as financial records, customer information, and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On the other hand, NoSQL databases are designed for storing and managing unstructured data such as documents, videos, images, and social media data. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema, which means they can store data in a variety of ways such as key-value pairs, document-based, graph-based, or column-oriented. NoSQL databases can handle large volumes of data and offer high scalability, availability, and performance. NoSQL databases are often used for managing unstructured data in big data applications, web applications, and real-time data processing systems."

    "   \n",

    "   ADD age INT;\n",
    "   \n",
