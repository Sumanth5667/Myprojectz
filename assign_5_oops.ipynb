    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It provides data hiding and abstraction, allowing the internal details of an object to be hidden and accessed only through the defined interface. Encapsulation helps in organizing and structuring code, improving code maintainability and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of the base classes, thereby promoting code reuse and establishing an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical class structures and supports concepts like polymorphism and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or types. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be defined in a generic way, capable of operating on objects of different classes, and the specific implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing complex real-world entities as simplified models within the program. It focuses on capturing only the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define common properties and methods for related classes. It helps in managing complexity, providing a clear and concise structure to the code, and separating the interface from the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars together form the foundation of object-oriented programming paradigms, providing principles and techniques to model real-world concepts, promote code reusability, enhance modularity, and make code more maintainable and scalable."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the `self` keyword is used as a convention to refer to the instance of a class within its methods. Here's why `self` is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `self` helps differentiate between instance attributes and local variables. It allows us to access and modify the attributes of an object within its methods, ensuring we are working with the specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It enables code reusability by allowing multiple objects to exist simultaneously, each with its own set of attribute values. `self` ensures that attribute modifications occur on the correct instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `self` facilitates encapsulation by providing a reference to the current instance. It allows for secure access to object attributes, preventing accidental modification or unwanted side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is a common convention in most object-oriented languages, making the code more readable and understandable. Developers can easily identify that `self` refers to the current instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `self` is used when invoking other methods within a class, ensuring that the correct instance is being referenced throughout the method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The use of `self` allows for the implementation of inheritance and polymorphism, as it ensures that overridden methods can correctly refer to the instance they are called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, `self` is a fundamental part of OOP, providing a way to access and manipulate the attributes of an object within its methods, enabling encapsulation, code reusability, and supporting the principles of inheritance and polymorphism."
