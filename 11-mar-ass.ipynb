    "\n",
    "**T-test:**\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. It is more appropriate when dealing with small samples because it takes into account the uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation instead of the population standard deviation. There are two main types of t-tests: the independent samples t-test and the paired samples t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenario for a t-test:**\n",
    "Let's say you want to test whether there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two groups of students (Group A and Group B) who have undergone different teaching methods. Since you only have a small number of students in each group and you don't know the population standard deviation, you would use an independent samples t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",

    "**Z-test:**\n",
    "A z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known or can be reasonably estimated. It is an approximation of the t-test when the sample size is sufficiently large, and it relies on the standard normal distribution (z-distribution). The z-test is more powerful and accurate when the sample size is large.\n",

In this case, you could use a z-test to test whether the average height of your sample is significantly different from a known population mean height.\n",

    "A one-tailed test, also known as a one-sided test, is a type of statistical hypothesis test in which the alternative hypothesis is formulated to detect a difference or relationship in one specific direction. In other words, it tests whether a parameter is significantly greater than or significantly less than a certain value, but not both. The critical region for the test is located on only one side of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you are testing whether a new drug increases the average response time in a task. Your null hypothesis (H0) could be that the drug has no effect on response time, and your alternative hypothesis (H1) would state that the drug increases response time. This is a one-tailed test because you are only interested in detecting an increase in response time.\n",

    "Two-Tailed Test:\n",
    "A two-tailed test, also known as a two-sided test, is a type of statistical hypothesis test in which the alternative hypothesis is formulated to detect a difference or relationship in either direction. It tests whether a parameter is significantly different from a certain value, without specifying whether it's greater or less. The critical region for the test is split between both sides of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say you are investigating whether a coin is fair (50% chance of heads and 50% chance of tails). Your null hypothesis (H0) could be that the coin is fair, and your alternative hypothesis (H1) would state that the coin is not fair. In this case, you are interested in detecting any significant deviation from the expected 50% probability in either direction, making it a two-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests lies in the directionality of the alternative hypothesis and the corresponding critical regions. One-tailed tests focus on a specific direction of effect (either greater or smaller), while two-tailed tests are more general and detect differences in either direction. The choice between the two types of tests depends on the research question and the specific hypothesis being tested."

Due to factors like small sample size or test limitations, your analysis fails to reject the null hypothesis, and you conclude that the test is not effective, when it actually is. This would be a Type 2 error.\n",

    "It's important to note that there is a trade-off between Type 1 and Type 2 errors. As you decrease the risk of one type of error, the risk of the other type of error may increase. This trade-off is typically controlled by setting a significance level (alpha, α) for the test, which determines the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Type 1 errors involve falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis, while Type 2 errors involve failing to reject a false null hypothesis. Both types of errors are inherent in hypothesis testing and should be considered when interpreting the results of statistical analyses.
