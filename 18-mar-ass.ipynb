    "### Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "A1. The Filter method is a feature selection technique that evaluates the relevance of each feature independently of the machine learning algorithm. It involves using statistical and correlation-based metrics to rank or score features. Common metrics include chi-squared test, mutual information, correlation coefficients, and variance. Features are then selected or ranked based on these scores, and a certain number of top-scoring features are retained. The filter method is computationally efficient but doesn't consider feature interactions."

    "### Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "A2. The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets based on the performance of a machine learning algorithm. It involves systematically trying different combinations of features and measuring the impact on the model's performance. Common techniques in the Wrapper method include forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination. This method is computationally expensive but considers feature interactions and is more suitable when the goal is to optimize a specific machine learning model's performance."

    "### Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "A3. Embedded feature selection methods combine feature selection with the training process of a machine learning algorithm. Common techniques include Lasso (L1 regularization), Ridge (L2 regularization), decision tree-based feature importance, and various forms of feature engineering and feature selection within the model training process. These methods select features while the model is being trained and are generally efficient in terms of both computation and feature selection."
